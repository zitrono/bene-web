### Step-by-Step Deployment Process

#### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/zitrono/dev/web/bene

# Initialize Git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files to Git
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Ralph website for GitHub Pages deployment"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ralph-website.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

#### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.com
2. Click on the "Settings" tab in the repository menu
3. Scroll down to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"

#### 3. Custom Domain (Optional)
If you want to use a custom domain like `ralph.beneficious.com`:
1. In the "Pages" settings, enter your custom domain in the "Custom domain" field
2. Create a CNAME file in your repository root with your domain name
3. Configure your DNS provider to point to GitHub Pages

#### 4. Verification and Testing
- GitHub will provide a URL like `https://yourusername.github.io/ralph-website/`
- The deployment typically takes 5-10 minutes to become live
- Test all functionality, forms, and responsive design

### Post-Deployment Configuration

#### Google Forms Integration
The website is designed to work with Google Forms for data collection. To complete the integration:

1. **Create Google Forms**:
   - Demo request form with fields matching the website form
   - Newsletter signup form
   - SuperReturn meeting request form

2. **Update JavaScript**:
   - Replace placeholder URLs in `script.js` with actual Google Form URLs
   - Map form field names to Google Form entry IDs
   - Test form submissions to ensure proper data flow

3. **Configure Form Pre-filling**:
   - Use Google Forms' pre-filled link feature
   - Update the JavaScript functions to construct proper URLs with user data

#### Analytics Setup
To track website performance and user engagement:

1. **Google Analytics**:
   - Create Google Analytics 4 property
   - Add tracking code to the HTML head section
   - Configure goals and conversions for form submissions

2. **Event Tracking**:
   - The JavaScript file includes placeholder analytics calls
   - Replace console.log statements with actual analytics events
   - Track CTA clicks, form interactions, and scroll depth

## Content Management

### Updating Website Content
Since this is a static site, content updates require code changes and redeployment:

1. Edit the relevant files (HTML for content, CSS for styling)
2. Test changes locally by opening `index.html` in a browser
3. Commit and push changes to GitHub
4. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and deploy

### Adding SVG Illustrations
The website includes descriptive placeholders for SVG-based images throughout. To add actual visuals:

1. Create or source SVG files that match the placeholder descriptions
2. Replace the `.visual-placeholder` divs with actual `<svg>` elements
3. Ensure SVGs are optimized for web delivery and accessibility
4. Maintain the existing CSS classes for proper styling and animation

### Form Customization
The forms can be customized by:

1. Modifying the HTML form fields in `index.html`
2. Updating the validation logic in `script.js`
3. Adjusting the styling in `styles.css`
4. Ensuring Google Forms integration remains compatible
