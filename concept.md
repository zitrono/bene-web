# Website Concept for Ralph - Autonomous Data Room Intelligence

## Overall Design Concept
The website will feature a clean, minimalist design with a sophisticated color palette using neutral tones and bold accent colors. The typography will be modern sans-serif throughout for a clean, contemporary feel. Visual elements will include abstract digital/data visualizations that subtly reinforce the AI capabilities without overwhelming the content. The glassmorphism UI style (frosted glass effect) will be used for key elements to create a modern, premium feel, with minimal, subtle animations to enhance user experience without distractions.

The website will be spacious with limited text, focusing on high-level overview and key value propositions rather than exhaustive detail. Abstract patterns will subtly suggest intelligence throughout the design elements rather than explicit AI imagery.
