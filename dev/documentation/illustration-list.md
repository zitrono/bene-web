# Ralph Website - Required SVG Illustrations List

## Project Context

### About Ralph
Ralph is an autonomous AI-powered data room intelligence solution designed specifically for private equity firms. Ralph functions as a dedicated data room analyst that continuously processes thousands of documents, identifies risks and opportunities, and provides actionable intelligence to accelerate due diligence processes.

### Target Audience
The primary audience consists of senior private equity partners, managing directors, and investment professionals who need to conduct thorough due diligence on potential investments within compressed timeframes. These are sophisticated financial professionals who value efficiency, accuracy, and competitive advantage.

### Key Value Propositions
