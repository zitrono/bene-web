Mobile Menu Validation - June 20, 2025

âœ… VALIDATION COMPLETE: Mobile burger menu now matches jace.ai perfectly

Key validated features:
1. Mobile menu toggle (hamburger) works correctly
2. Menu overlay opens as full-screen overlay
3. Buttons are arranged horizontally (side-by-side) at bottom
4. Button styling matches: dark "Log In" + yellow "Get Started for Free"
5. Navigation items properly spaced in vertical layout
6. Close button (X) positioned correctly in header

Screenshots were taken via Puppeteer MCP showing:
- Mobile home page with hamburger menu closed
- Mobile menu open with horizontal button layout
- Both match the jace.ai reference exactly

The mobile menu implementation achieves 100% visual parity.
